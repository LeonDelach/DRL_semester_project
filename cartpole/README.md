# CartPole



cartpole_dqn_doc.py is the Python script to train a DQN agent to solve the CartPole environment.

FF_Cartpole_supervised.ipynb is the notebook to train a FF agent to solve the CartPole environment.

pg_cartpole.py is a Python script to train an agent with the policy gradient algorithm (PG), which is a deep RL algorithm. I made tests but the PG is no more used and the DQN agent was performing better.
